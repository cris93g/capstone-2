Object Oriented Programming Concept Questions

As you should know by now, there are 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming.

********************
1. Encapsulation
    pretty much is hiding values or data of a class so they become either read or write only by using either getters or setters.You can achieve this by making variables private than using a get method.







********************
2. Inheritance
    almost how some developers say dont write a method twice or dry its the act of passing values from one class to another.By using the super u can bring those values.







********************
3. Abstraction
    The act of thinking and creating things to their most simplest terms.Interfaces and abstract classes use this they bring values that are common to items that are of the same type.







********************
4. Polymorphism
   The act of mutating values from a child class.A simple class could have something like make a sound but classes coming froom that one can expand and override that sound with their own implementation of it.






Please write 1-3 paragraphs explaining these 4 concepts further.  Please provide a sufficient enough explanation about these pillars, as well as some examples to illustrate the practical use cases of these principles.
